One failure on
Top of another"
"2016/05/25 1:47:13 PM EST","When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee and then my state,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
   For thy sweet love remembred such wealth brings
   That then I scorn to change my state with kings."
"2016/05/25 1:47:53 PM EST","Art thou abroad on this stormy night 
on thy journey of love, my friend? 
The sky groans like one in despair.
 

I have no sleep tonight.
 
Ever and again I open my door and look out on 
the darkness, my friend! 

I can see nothing before me.
 
I wonder where lies thy path! 

By what dim shore of the ink-black river, 
by what far edge of the frowning forest, 
through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading 
thy course to come to me my friend?"
"2016/05/25 1:50:44 PM EST","Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea,
But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.
Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;
For tho from out our bourne of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crost the bar."
"2016/05/25 1:52:38 PM EST","When April bends above me
And finds me fast asleep,
Dust need not keep the secret
A live heart died to keep.

When April tells the thrushes,
The meadow-larks will know,
And pipe the three words lightly
To all the winds that blow.

Above his roof the swallows,
In notes like far-blown rain,
Will tell the little sparrow
Beside his window-pane.

O sparrow, little sparrow,
When I am fast asleep,
Then tell my love the secret
That I have died to keep."
"2016/05/25 1:52:59 PM EST","Between your sheets you soundly sleep
Nor dreams of vigils that we lovers keep
While all the night, I waking sign your name,
The tender sound does every nerve inflame,
Imagination shows me all your charms,
The plenteous silken hair, and waxen arms,
The well turned neck, and snowy rising breast
And all the beauties that supinely rest
between your sheets.

Ah Lindamira, could you see my heart,
How fond, how true, how free from fraudful art,
The warmest glances poorly do explain
The eager wish, the melting throbbing pain
Which through my very blood and soul I feel,
Which you cannot believe nor I reveal,
Which every metaphor must render less
And yet (methinks) which I could well express
between your sheets."
"2016/05/25 1:53:20 PM EST","I want a red dress.
I want it flimsy and cheap,
I want it too tight, I want to wear it
until someone tears it off me.
I want it sleeveless and backless,
this dress, so no one has to guess
what's underneath. I want to walk down
the street past Thrifty's and the hardware store
with all those keys glittering in the window,
past Mr. and Mrs. Wong selling day-old
donuts in their cafe, past the Guerra brothers
slinging pigs from the truck and onto the dolly,
hoisting the slick snouts over their shoulders.
I want to walk like I'm the only
woman on earth and I can have my pick.
I want that red dress bad.
I want it to confirm
your worst fears about me,
to show you how little I care about you
or anything except what
I want. When I find it, I'll pull that garment
from its hanger like I'm choosing a body
to carry me into this world, through
the birth-cries and the love-cries too,
and I'll wear it like bones, like skin,
it'll be the goddamned
dress they bury me in."
"2016/05/25 1:53:37 PM EST","Sublime cool breezes
Relieve, hot sultry moments.
Wax and wanes against the tide
Forgive, under soft moonlight.
Passes over us like a storm
Feel, the pause of exhileration.
Moving ripples in the stream
Hope, in the shallows of darkness.
Splendour of raindrops
Listen, to the moments lost.
Perpetuates plunge from the Jetty
Nuture, the joy of faith.
Plummet into the Abyss
Breathe, the rise and fall of emotion."
"2016/05/25 1:54:22 PM EST","Love, if I weep it will not matter,
And if you laugh I shall not care;
Foolish am I to think about it,
But it is good to feel you there.

Love, in my sleep I dreamed of waking,
White and awful the moonlight reached
Over the floor, and somewhere, somewhere
There was a shutter loose- it screeched!

Swung in the wind- and no wind blowing-
I was afraid and turned to you,
Put out my hand to you for comfort-
And you were gone! Cold as the dew,

Under my hand the moonlight lay!
Love, if you laugh I shall not care,
But if I weep it will not matter-
Ah, it is good to feel you there."
"2016/05/25 1:54:52 PM EST","All our time together as the days pass us by,
is not easy for me without you by my side......
I promise not to feel this pain and learn to smile,
'Coz i know that we'll make it through til the end of time...."
"2016/05/25 1:55:06 PM EST","One day I wrote her name upon the strand,
But came the waves and washed it away:
Again I wrote it with a second hand,
But came the tide and made my pains his prey.
""Vain man,"" said she, ""that dost in vain essay
A mortal thing so to immortalize;
For I myself shall like to this decay,
And eke my name be wiped out likewise.""
""Not so,"" quoth I; ""let baser things devise
To lie in dust, but you shall live by fame;
My verse your virtues rare shall eternize,
And in the heavens write you glorious name:
Where, whenas Death shall all the world subdue,
Our love shall live, and later life renew."""
"2016/05/25 1:55:31 PM EST","I cant seem to get, you off of my mind
I cant seem to keep, you from swimming in my brain
To me these words just all sound the same
So what should I do to help ease the pain?
These roots they run deep
And I cant seem to keep
Your name off my tounge
And its making me weak
Your the one that I seek
And theres nowhere to look
No pages hold it, that I can read in a book
I can see you when you sleep
I can hear you when you weep
I lie awake at Night
Feeling Lonesome and Tired
Will you set me free?
Will you be for me?
Was it meant to be?
Is it destiny?
Cast out to the sea
On the second degree
Knife in my Head
Knife in my Back
Bullet in my Side
Gun in my Bed
We've danced before
But ever again?
I cant seem to loose
I cant seem to win
Playing cards I was dealt
Feeling things Ive never felt
Roads that are Winding
But not ever Finding
Untie me Im binding
And I feel like im Dying
I cant seem to stop
Im still at the bottom
But reach for the top
I wait and I mourn
While seconds are torn
I get word from the horn
Again I am born
Damn all the Men
With Light in their eyes
They cant seem to see
All the Lies and the Cries
I despise my allies
Their Spys in the Sky
And althought this may seem unwise
I disguise their demise
For she is the prize
The salt in my Cup
I drink it all down
And Close it all up
Again I say,
I cant seem to get, you off of my Mind
Day after day this is my grind
Row beyond row I march in the Line
And yet this love goes on undefined
So ease my Pain
And seize this day
And do not let this love decay
We're not even close
Not even Halfway
Allow me the chance
To let me repay
All the debts that I owe
And our Love it will Grow
I cant seem to get, You off of my mind"
"2016/05/25 1:56:26 PM EST","e poured it in her ear, the idea

of him on top, slowing time down
to enter her, convincing her
that everything would stay between them,
with his back to the air
and her bottom on the mattress,
their motions surrounded by
the smell of love and fabric softener.

She wanted him behind her, a position
of trust, tossing aside suspicions
of what he might do behind her back
and how easily he could hide
who else he might be thinking of.

But he did not want to look over her shoulder,

he wanted to be in her eyes,
moving his hips in slow clock-
wise
rotation,

making the cold stone expression
on her face crumble.
She'd been wearing her countenance that way

since the first day they met,
after one lover refused to stay inside her
and another was so indecisive, she was forced
to mount the problem and dominate.

But no more.

And she cried because he did everything
he said he would do to her
but when he was finished, he did not leave."
"2016/05/25 2:12:04 PM EST","Yesterday we walked apart
Separate and cold and mortal.
Now the sacred kiss has joined us,
Now we stand inside the portal

That permits of no returning
And my heart is burning, burning.

I know not what the word may be,
Or what the charm, or what the token
That has filled us with this glory,
But never let the spell be broken;

Let it stay a mystery
For all times to be.

Yesterday, with lighter joys
We wantoned at the outer portal.
Now, with love's old alchemy
We have made ourselves immortal."
"2016/05/25 2:12:46 PM EST","Sublime cool breezes
Relieve, hot sultry moments.
Wax and wanes against the tide
Forgive, under soft moonlight.
Passes over us like a storm
Feel, the pause of exhileration.
Moving ripples in the stream
Hope, in the shallows of darkness.
Splendour of raindrops
Listen, to the moments lost.
Perpetuates plunge from the Jetty
Nuture, the joy of faith.
Plummet into the Abyss
Breathe, the rise and fall of emotion."
"2016/05/25 2:13:11 PM EST","Draw not away thy hands, my love,
With wind alone the branches move,
And though the leaves be scant above
The Autumn shall not shame us.

Say; Let the world wax cold and drear,
What is the worst of all the year
But life, and what can hurt us, dear,
Or death, and who shall blame us?

Ah, when the summer comes again
How shall we say, we sowed in vain?
The root was joy, the stem was pain
The ear a nameless blending.

The root is dead and gone, my love,
The stem's a rod our truth to prove;
The ear is stored for nought to move
Till heaven and earth have ending."
"2016/05/25 2:13:28 PM EST","Never seek to tell thy love,
Love that never told can be;
For the gentle wind doth move
Silently, invisibly.

I told my love, I told my love,
I told her all my heart,
Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears.
Ah! she did depart!

Soon after she was gone from me,
A traveller came by,
Silently, invisibly:
He took her with a sigh."
"2016/05/25 2:14:31 PM EST","Could you love a bee
that buzzed, tickled your ear,
brought tiny legs up to lips,
while amber honey dripped
down your breast?
And if he followed it there
carried it down
to the place where you open
like flowers, clear petals. If wings
grew tongues, and he said
you were enough
the very essence of you
that he could live, grow
in the sweet sugar of your hip.

Would you then turn and walk away?
Say he is not a man with legs,
speak of spiders or ants
who would deny you both a place.
What if these were not reasons
just something you said,
for the hum had grown so sweet,
you realized an ability to sting."
"2016/05/25 2:14:40 PM EST","I loved him most
when he came home from work,
his fingers still curled from fitting pipe,
his denim shirt ringed with sweat
and smelling of salt, the drying weeds
of the ocean. I would go to him where he sat
on the edge of the bed, his forehead
anointed with grease, his cracked hands
jammed between his thighs, and unlace
the steel-toed boots, stroke his ankles,
his calves, the pads and bones of his feet.
Then I'd open his clothes and take
the whole day inside me-the ship's
gray sides, the miles of copper pipe,
the voice of the first man clanging
off the hull's silver ribs, spark of lead
kissing metal, the clamp, the winch,
the white fire of the torch, the whistle
and the long drive home."
"2016/05/25 2:14:54 PM EST","Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today
Tomorrow will be dying.

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
The higher he's a-getting,
The sooner will his race be run,
And nearer he's to setting.

That age is best which is the first,
When youth and blood are warmer;
But being spent, the worse, and worst
Times still succeed the former.

Then be not coy, but use your time,
And while ye may, go marry;
For having lost but once your prime,
You may forever tarry."
"2016/05/25 2:15:04 PM EST","My hands
open the curtains of your being
clothe you in a further nudity
uncover the bodies of your body
My hands
invent another body for your body"
"2016/05/25 2:15:47 PM EST","A book of verse, underneath the bough,
A jug of wine, a loaf of bread - and thou
Beside me singing in the wilderness -
Ah, wilderness were paradise enow!"
"2016/05/25 2:15:58 PM EST","Ah, my beloved, fill the cup that clears
Today of past regrets and future fears;
Tomorrow? Why, tomorrow I may be,
Myself, with yesterday's sev'n thousand years."
"2016/05/25 2:16:09 PM EST","Come, fill the cup, and in the fire of spring
Your winter garment of repentance fling.
The bird of time has but a little way
To flutter - and the bird is on the wing."
"2016/05/25 2:16:22 PM EST","Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars -alights,
And is lost in balms!"
"2016/05/25 2:16:33 PM EST","When you came, you were like red wine and honey,
And the taste of you burnt my mouth with its sweetness.
Now you are like morning bread,
Smooth and pleasant.
I hardly taste you at all for I know your savour,
But I am completely nourished."
"2016/05/25 2:17:14 PM EST","Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.

Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.

Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands."
"2016/05/25 2:17:29 PM EST","For each ecstatic instant
We must an anguish pay.
In keen and quivering ratio
To the ecstasy.

For each beloved hour
Sharp pittances of years,
Bitter contested farthings
And coffers heaped with tears."
"2016/05/25 2:17:40 PM EST","225 days under grass
and you know more than I.
they have long taken your blood,
you are a dry stick in a basket.
is this how it works?
in this room
the hours of love
still make shadows.
when you left
you took almost
everything.
I kneel in the nights
before tigers
that will not let me be.

what you were
will not happen again.
the tigers have found me
and I do not care."
"2016/05/25 2:17:50 PM EST","For some we loved, the loveliest and the best
That from His vintage rolling Time hath pressed,
Have drunk the Cup a round or two before,
And one by one crept silently to rest."
"2016/05/25 2:18:01 PM EST","You ask me what since we must part
You shall bring back to me.
Bring back a pure and faithful heart
As true as mine to thee.

You talk of gems from foreign lands,
Of treasure, spoil, and prize.
Ah love! I shall not search your hands
But look into your eyes."
"2016/05/25 2:18:25 PM EST","Marriage is not
a house or even a tent
it is before that, and colder:
The edge of the forest, the edge
of the desert
the unpainted stairs
at the back where we squat
outside, eating popcorn
where painfully and with wonder
at having survived even
this far
we are learning to make fire"
"2016/05/25 2:18:50 PM EST","Hope is a thing with feathers
That perches in the soul
And sings a tune without words
And never stops at all.

And sweetest, in the gale, is heard
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little bird
That keeps so many warm.

I?ve heard it in the chilliest land
And on the strangest sea
Yet, never, in extremity
It ask a crumb of me."
"2016/05/25 2:19:00 PM EST","I am in love with him
To whom a hyacinth is dearer
Than I shall ever be dear.

On nights when the field-mice
Are abroad, he cannot sleep.
He hears their narrow teeth
At the bulbs of his hyacinths.

But the gnawing at my heart...
He does not hear."
"2016/05/25 2:19:11 PM EST","I held a jewel in my fingers
And went to sleep
The day was warm, and winds were prosy
I said, ""Twill keep""

I woke - and chide my honest fingers,
The Gem was gone
And now, an Amethyst remembrance
Is all I own"
"2016/05/25 2:19:24 PM EST","My love is like to ice, and I to fire:
How come it then that this her cold is so great
Is not dissolved through my so hot desire,
But harder grows the more I her entreat?
Or how comes it that my exceeding heat
Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,
But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,
And feel my flames augmented manifold?
What more miraculous thing may be told,
That fire, which is congealed with senseless cold,
Should kindle fire by wonderful device?
Such is the power of love in gentle mind,
That it can alter all the course of kind."
"2016/05/25 2:19:41 PM EST","I never lost as much but twice,
And that was in the sod.
Twice have I stood a beggar
Before the door of God!

Angels, twice descending,
Reimbursed my store.
Burglar, banker, father,
I am poor once more!"
"2016/05/25 2:19:54 PM EST","For some we loved, the loveliest and the best
That from His vintage rolling Time hath pressed,
Have drunk the Cup a round or two before,
And one by one crept silently to rest."
"2016/05/25 2:20:08 PM EST","I wish I could remember the first day,
First hour, first moment of your meeting me;
If bright or dim the season it might be;
Summer or winter for aught I can say.
So, unrecorded did it slip away,
So blind was i to see and to forsee,
So dull to mark the budding of my tree
That would not blossom, yet, for many a May.

If only I could recollect it! Such
A day of days! I let it come and go
As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow.
It seemed to mean so little, meant so much!
If only now I could recall that touch,
First touch of hand in hand! - Did one but know!"
"2016/05/25 2:20:36 PM EST","I sometimes think that never blows so red
The rose as where some buried Caesar bled.
That every hyacinth the garden wears;
Dropt in her lap from some once lovely head."
"2016/05/25 2:20:47 PM EST","You smiled, you spoke and I believed,
By every word and smile- deceived.

Another man would hope no more;
Nor hope I- what I hoped before.

But let not this last wish be vain;
Deceive, deceive me once again!"
"2016/05/25 2:20:59 PM EST","A book of verse, underneath the bough,
A jug of wine, a loaf of bread - and thou
Beside me singing in the wilderness -
Ah, wilderness were paradise enow!"
"2016/05/25 2:21:19 PM EST","You left me, sweet, two legacies, -
A legacy of love
A Heavenly Father would content,
Had He the offer of;

You left me boundaries of pain
Capacious as the sea,
Between eternity and time,
Your consciousness and me."
"2016/05/25 2:21:45 PM EST","Tell me not, Sweet, I am unkind
For, from the nunnery
Of thy chaste breast, and quiet mind,
To war and arms I fly.

True, a new mistress now I chase,
The first foe in the field;
And with a stronger faith- embrace
A sword, a horse, a shield.

Yet this unconstancy is such
As you too shall adore;
For, I could not love thee, Dear, so much,
Loved I not honour more."
"2016/05/25 2:21:57 PM EST","Come, fill the cup, and in the fire of spring
Your winter garment of repentance fling.
The bird of time has but a little way
To flutter - and the bird is on the wing."
"2016/05/25 2:22:16 PM EST","Why did you hold me
With my head against your heart
A taste of forbidden fantasy
From the very start

A question without an answer
A story without an end
A thief who stole something broken
He can't find a way to mend

Trapped in your shoe box
Forgotten beneath the bed
Hidden in the darkness
Beside a book you never read

Everyone has a secret
They hope the world will never find
Was this all I was to you
When you were all that was on my mind

You spun me a lie
Into a beautiful tapestry
A bitter-sweet fairytale
You knew could never be

What would I give, if I
Could turn back times hand
And run my fingers through
The lost hour glass sand

If I could page back through the days
And change the very start
I'd put my head right back against
The beating of your heart

Cause we are..
A question without an answer
A story without an end
You're the thief who made my heart broken
Now there's nothing left to mend"
"2016/05/25 2:22:46 PM EST","All my past life is mine no more,
The flying hours are gone,
Like transitory dreams given o'er,
Whose images are kept in store
By memory alone.

Whatever is to come is not;
How can it then be mine?
The present moment's all my lot;
And that, as fast as it is got,
Phyllis, is wholly thine.

Then talk not of inconstancy,
False hearts, and broken vows;
If I, by miracle, can be
This live-long minute true to thee,
'Tis all that heaven allows."
