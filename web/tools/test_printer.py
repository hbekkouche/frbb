poem=""" Lady,i will touch you with\n my mind. Touch you and touch\n and touch until you give me\n suddenly a smile,shyly\n obscene\n ==============================\n Love is a fire. But whether\n it is going to warm your\n heart or burn down your\n house, you can never tell.\n ==============================\n one must be one to ever be\n two and if you were a day Id\n find a way to live through\n you\n ==============================\n I think she wanted to explain\n the silence hidden within her\n voice blue egg in the\n nettles. She wrote something\n on a rock, used the rock to\n bash in the skull of an\n injured deer. Bloodied\n swan-neck arms. She slinks\n into her own viscera, a baby\n fox backing into its\n trunkhole. The wordbone's\n connected to the gutbone.\n Meanwhile, her desire for\n nobody now bucks like a\n rabbit under her ground.\n ==============================\n The sun's gone dim, and The\n moon's turned black; For I\n loved him, and He didn't love\n back.\n ==============================\n When the sea has devoured the\n ships, And the spires and the\n towers Have gone back to the\n hills. And all the cities Are\n one with the plains again.\n And the beauty of bronze, And\n the strength of steel Are\n blown over silent continents,\n As the desert sand is blown\n My dust with yours forever.\n ==============================\n Just because people love your\n mind, doesn't mean they have\n to have your body, too.\n ==============================\n Words from a leaf on the\n shell of a snail? Tendency as\n reciprocity etched in shale.\n Cider vinegar wrapped in\n sealskin? Accept it, so\n little is genuine. A box on a\n meteor compelled by earth?\n Lies, emptiness, grief: its\n not a first. Frost on the\n dock at Penetanguishene?\n Tears from Lake Huron, Erie,\n and Michigan. Not a moment to\n yourself? Dont let love put\n you on a shelf. A\n preponderance of errors? The\n soft one sucks her rivers.\n Love, love, needs no reason.\n Yes, yes, yes, is my season.\n
May 24 01:37:00 mrbunny sh[391]: ==============================\n His artfully unkempt\n strawberry blonde head sports\n outsized headphones. Like a\n contemporary bust. Behold the\n innocence of the freckles,\n ripe pout of cherry lips. As\n if the mere sight of the\n world hurts him, he squints\n greenly and applies saline\n drops. You dream him crying\n over you. For the duration of\n a subway ride you fall\n blindly in love. Until he\n exits. Or you exit, returning\n home to the one you truly\n love to ravish him.\n"""
